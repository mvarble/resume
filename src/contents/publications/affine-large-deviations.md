We prove a large deviations principle (LDP) on the Skorokhod space $\mathbb{D}_{\mathbb{X}}[0,\infty)$ for families $(\epsilon X^\epsilon)_{\epsilon>0}$ of affine processes $\epsilon X^\epsilon$ taking values in some abstract subset $\mathbb{X}$ of a vector space $\mathbb{V}$.
The regime is of the small-noise Friedlin-Wentzel form, coming from natural mean-field phenomena.
Our proof requires small tails of the associated affine jump kernel $\mu$ (i.e. $\int_{|v| > 1} e^{\langle u, v\rangle} \mu(x, {\rm d}v) < \infty$ for all $u \in \mathbb{V}$) whereas previous results required $\mu = 0$ and $\mathbb{X}$ to be a canonical space.
