This paper is concerned with the state-estimation problem of locating an emitter which radiates both direct and reflected paths, signaling a receiver with angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements of each path.
Locations of the emitter and each reflected image form correlated states we estimate using sequential Monte Carlo methods; we associate signals of these sources with our estimator through an AOA-greedy algorithm which allows us to use TDOA signals.
