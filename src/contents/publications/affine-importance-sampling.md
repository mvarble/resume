title: Importance sampling of affine processes
journal: pending

Our LDP (from the above paper) induces an importance sampling scheme parameterized by functions $\theta: [0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{V}$.
Our proof indicates that no efficiency is loss when selecting $\theta$ from a specific family of piecewise functions which may be easily calibrated.
These suggest an exact sampling algorithm of which we prove equivalent efficiency.
