I seek a job in industry which allows me to explore my mathematical interests and sharpen my software engineering skills.
I will offer understanding of generative machine-learning models through a comprehensive understanding probability concepts.
Ideally, I will also take part in software development of highly-scalable systems under a strong team from which I may learn and grow.
